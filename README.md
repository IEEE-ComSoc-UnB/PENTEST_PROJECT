# PENTEST_PROJECT

This is a project to research and find vulnerabilities in wireless networks. Thus we will use well-known techniques and attacks in controlled networks to simulate real situations and obtain results. As vulnerabilities are encountered we will begin the search process to address this vulnerability, thereby reducing or completely ending it.
